Some weights of RoSTERModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at roberta-base and are newly initialized: ['classifier.weight', 'bin_classifier.bias', 'lm_head.decoder.bias', 'classifier.bias', 'bin_classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

Some weights of RoSTERModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at roberta-base and are newly initialized: ['classifier.weight', 'bin_classifier.bias', 'lm_head.decoder.bias', 'classifier.bias', 'bin_classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

Some weights of RoSTERModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at roberta-base and are newly initialized: ['classifier.weight', 'bin_classifier.bias', 'lm_head.decoder.bias', 'classifier.bias', 'bin_classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

Some weights of RoSTERModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at roberta-base and are newly initialized: ['classifier.weight', 'bin_classifier.bias', 'lm_head.decoder.bias', 'classifier.bias', 'bin_classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

Some weights of RoSTERModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at roberta-base and are newly initialized: ['classifier.weight', 'bin_classifier.bias', 'lm_head.decoder.bias', 'classifier.bias', 'bin_classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

Some weights of RoSTERModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at roberta-base and are newly initialized: ['classifier.weight', 'bin_classifier.bias', 'lm_head.decoder.bias', 'classifier.bias', 'bin_classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
