"We wandered shyly hand in hand," "Or rollicked in the fairy sand" "And gathered pearls and shells in pails," "While all about the nightingales" "Were singing in the trees." "We dug for silver with our spades" "By little inland sparkling seas," "Then ran ashore through sleepy seas," "And down a warm and winding lane" "And never never found again" "Between high whispering trees." "The air was neither night or day," "But faintly dark with softest light," "When first there glimmered into sight The Cottage of Lost Play." "Twas builded very very old" "White, and thatched with straws of gold," "And pierced with peeping lattices" "That looked toward the sea;" "And our own childrens garden-plots" "Were there--our own forgetmenots," "Red daisies, cress and mustard," "And blue nemophile." "O! All the borders trimmed with box" "Were full of favourite flowers - of phlox," "Of larkspur, pinks, and hollyhocks" "Beneath a red may-tree:" "And all the paths were full of shapes," "Of tumbling happy white-clad shapes," "And with them You and Me."
